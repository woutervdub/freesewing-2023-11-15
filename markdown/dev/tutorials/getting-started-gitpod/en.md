If you don't want to set up a dev environment or if you just want to kick the
tires like, right now, you can run our development environment in your browser via Gitpod:

https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/freesewing/freesewing

<Tip>
We recommend that you instead fork our repository and use Gitpod with
your fork so you can make changes and push them to your repository on Gitpod.
To do so, simple adapt the URL above as follows:

https://gitpod.io/#url-to-your-fork
