title: Conclusion
order: 280
---

Congratulations, we have created our first pattern. And while it's arguably
rather simple, we have learned a bunch of things along the way. Let's list
some of the things we've learned:

- We learned how to [setup our development environment][new-design] with `npx
  @freesewing/new-design`
- We learned about [the different files and folders][structure] in the
  development environment and how `design/src` holds our source code.
- We learned about [parts][our-first-part] and how they are structured.
- We learned how to add [measurements][adding-measurements], and
  [options][adding-options] to our design.
- We learned about [a part's draft method][draft-method] and how to destructure
  what we need to design our part.
- We learned [how to add points and draw paths][constructing-the-neck-opening]
- We learned how we can make changes in a loop to [adapt the neck
  opening][fitting-the-neck-opening] or [rotate the straps][avoiding-overlap]
  until they were just right
- We learned about [macros and how to use them][creating-the-closure]
- We learned there are many methods that allow us to manipulate
  [points](/reference/api/point/) and [paths](/reference/api/path/)
- We learned about what it means to draft [a complete
  pattern][completing-our-pattern]
- We learned about [snippets and how to add them][completing-our-pattern]
- We learned [how to offset a path][completing-our-pattern] to create seam
  allowance, or in our case, mark the bias tape line
- We learned how to support a [paperless pattern][paperless] by adding
  dimensions

## More reading material

- If you haven't done so already, read through [the pattern
  guide](/guides/patterns/) which provides a good overview of how patterns work
  under the hood
- Bookmark [the FreeSewing API docs](/reference/api/), they are your reference
  every time you're not entirely certain how something works
- Have a look at [the design guide](/guides/best-practices/) for best practices
  that will help you make the best possible patterns

## What to do next

Now that you have learned how to create a pattern, why don't you make one?

Think about what it is you would like to create, and just do it. If you get
stuck at any moment, or need some help or advice, you can [join our chat
room](https://discord.freesewing.org/) and we'll help you out.

##### How did I do?

You could do me a real favor by letting me know what you loved or hated about
this tutorial.

Were there areas that were not clear? Did I dwell too long on one topic, or
rushed through another one too quickly?  Your feedback helps improve things,
so don't be shy and [tell me what you think](https://discord.freesewing.org/).
